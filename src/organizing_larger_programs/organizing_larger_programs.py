    - In python, the app divided into packages with modules. Package in like a Java package (folder like), and a module is a single python file.
    - Package has the __path__ property that holds the package path

    - If the REPL doesn't recognize the path, we can add it manually: sys.path.append('folder_name')
    - Other options is to expor it via bash variable: EXPORT PYTHONPATH=folder_name

    The __file__ property holds the __init__.py file path.
    When a package is imported, the __init__.py is being executed. We can see it by placing print statement there.
    To run a module from a command line, use "python -m package_name.module_name"

    Import synthax:
    from package import module1, module2
    from .. import module1

    Using __all__
    The __all__ contains list of all public exports of the module(without underscores) when import * is used
    If not specified, all functions will be public
    Hint: use print(locals()) to view all local available variables

    Example of __init__.py with __all__:
    from package.module import func1 as f1
    from package2.module2 import func2 as f2
    __all__ = ['f1', 'f2']
